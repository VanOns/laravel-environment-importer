|------------|-----------------|
| PHP        | 8.0             |
| Laravel    | 10.0            |

### Installation

While the package is for internal use only, you can install it from GitHub. Add the following to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/VanOns/laravel-environment-importer"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then, install the package:

```bash
composer require van-ons/laravel-environment-importer
```

Next, publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="environment-importer-config"
```

Finally, open the configuration file (`config/environment-importer.php`) and adjust it to your needs.

### Usage

You can execute the import command by running:

```bash
php artisan environment:import
````
